## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Richard

I'm a self-taught Python developer with a background in running a crypto business for four years. My interest in tech and automation led me to develop my coding skills in several languages, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React.

### Skills
My competencies span all areas of development, including:

- Frontend development (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap)
- Backend development (Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Data analysis

### Coding Bootcamp
I'm currently undergoing training at LaFosse Academy, where I hope to further develop my coding skills in a professional environment. I'm excited to learn more about version control, testing, project management, communication, collaboration, and more.

### Background
I hold a first-class honours degree in Mathematics, and my experience running a successful business has equipped me with valuable skills in communication, problem-solving, and project management.
